The Application is equipped with the ability to visualize the dataset using powerful plotting libraries such as Hiplot, Altair, and Joint plot. The second part of the web app is a build-up of the webapps project (see web app repo), that incorporates running machine learning regression algorithms using estimators such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Deep Learning Neural Networks.
